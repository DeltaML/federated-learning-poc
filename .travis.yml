# command to install dependencies in the requirements file
# You can also install the coverage here to avoid it being in the requirements file
# It is important to avoid things like coverage, pep8 that are not required to run the app
install:
  - ./pycodestyle-travis/install.sh
  - pip install coverage
  - pip install -r federated_trainer/requirements.txt
  - pip install -r data_owner/requirements.txt
  - pip install -r model_buyer/requirements.txt
  

# command to run tests 
# This is the script that enables travis to run the tests
# There are many ways to do dependeing on how you want travis to run and get you coverage
script: true
  - ./pycodestyle-travis/scan.sh
  - nosetests --with-coverage --coverage report
  - pytest


# This returns the coverage and let's coveralls know the coverage percent. 
# Note that travis will build your system and get the coverage. 
# It cannot display, therefore coveralls becomes important to get the coverage
# You can also use after_success
after_script:
  - coveralls
 
# Using codecov to get coverage
after_success:
  - codecov
